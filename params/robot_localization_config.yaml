# REP-105 (http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0105.html) specifies four principal coordinate frames: base_link, odom, map, and
# earth. base_link is the coordinate frame that is affixed to the robot. Both odom and map are world-fixed frames.
# The robot's position in the odom frame will drift over time, but is accurate in the short term and should be
# continuous. The odom frame is therefore the best frame for executing local motion plans. The map frame, like the odom
# frame, is a world-fixed coordinate frame, and while it contains the most globally accurate position estimate for your
# robot, it is subject to discrete jumps, e.g., due to the fusion of GPS data or a correction from a map-based
# localization node. The earth frame is used to relate multiple map frames by giving them a common reference frame.
# ekf_localization_node and ukf_localization_node are not concerned with the earth frame.
# Here is how to use the following settings:
# 1. Set the map_frame, odom_frame, and base_link frames to the appropriate frame names for your system.
#     1a. If your system does not have a map_frame, just remove it, and make sure "world_frame" is set to the value of
#         odom_frame.
# 2. If you are fusing continuous position data such as wheel encoder odometry, visual odometry, or IMU data, set
#   "world_frame" to your odom_frame value. This is the default behavior for robot_localization's state estimation nodes.
# 3. If you are fusing global absolute position data that is subject to discrete jumps (e.g., GPS or position updates
# from landmark observations) then:
#     3a. Set your "world_frame" to your map_frame value
#     3b. MAKE SURE something else is generating the odom->base_link transform. Note that this can even be another state
#         estimation node from robot_localization! However, that instance should *not* fuse the global data.
map_frame: ""               # Defaults to "map" if unspecified
odom_frame: map             # Defaults to "odom" if unspecified

############ EXAMPLE SENSOR CONFIG ############
# The filter accepts an arbitrary number of inputs from each input message type (nav_msgs/Odometry,
# geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovarianceStamped, geometry_msgs/TwistWithCovarianceStamped,
# sensor_msgs/Imu). To add an input, simply append the next number in the sequence to its "base" name, e.g., odom0,
# odom1, twist0, twist1, imu0, imu1, imu2, etc. The value should be the topic name. These parameters obviously have no
# default values, and must be specified.
# odom0: example/topic

# Each sensor reading updates some or all of the filter's state. These options give you greater control over which
# values from each measurement are fed to the filter. For example, if you have an odometry message as input, but only
# want to use its Z position value, then set the entire vector to false, except for the third entry. The order of the
# values is x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw, vx, vy, vz, vroll, vpitch, vyaw, ax, ay, az. Note that not some message types
# do not provide some of the state variables estimated by the filter. For example, a TwistWithCovarianceStamped message
# has no pose information, so the first six values would be meaningless in that case. Each vector defaults to all false
# if unspecified, effectively making this parameter required for each sensor.
# odom0_config: [false, false, false,
#                false, false, false,
#                false, false, false,
#                false, false, false,
#                false, false, false]

# If you have high-frequency data or are running with a low frequency parameter value, then you may want to increase
# the size of the subscription queue so that more measurements are fused.
# odom0_queue_size: 2

# [ADVANCED] Large messages in ROS can exhibit strange behavior when they arrive at a high frequency. This is a result
# of Nagle's algorithm. This option tells the ROS subscriber to use the tcpNoDelay option, which disables Nagle's
# algorithm.
# odom0_nodelay: false

# [ADVANCED] When measuring one pose variable with two sensors, a situation can arise in which both sensors under-
# report their covariances. This can lead to the filter rapidly jumping back and forth between each measurement as they
# arrive. In these cases, it often makes sense to (a) correct the measurement covariances, or (b) if velocity is also
# measured by one of the sensors, let one sensor measure pose, and the other velocity. However, doing (a) or (b) isn't
# always feasible, and so we expose the differential parameter. When differential mode is enabled, all absolute pose
# data is converted to velocity data by differentiating the absolute pose measurements. These velocities are then
# integrated as usual. NOTE: this only applies to sensors that provide pose measurements; setting differential to true
# for twist measurements has no effect.
# odom0_differential: false

# [ADVANCED] When the node starts, if this parameter is true, then the first measurement is treated as a "zero point"
# for all future measurements. While you can achieve the same effect with the differential paremeter, the key
# difference is that the relative parameter doesn't cause the measurement to be converted to a velocity before
# integrating it. If you simply want your measurements to start at 0 for a given sensor, set this to true.
# odom0_relative: false

# [ADVANCED] If your data is subject to outliers, use these threshold settings, expressed as Mahalanobis distances, to
# control how far away from the current vehicle state a sensor measurement is permitted to be. Each defaults to
# numeric_limits<double>::max() if unspecified. It is strongly recommended that these parameters be removed if not
# required. Data is specified at the level of pose and twist variables, rather than for each variable in isolation.
# For messages that have both pose and twist data, the parameter specifies to which part of the message we are applying
# the thresholds.
